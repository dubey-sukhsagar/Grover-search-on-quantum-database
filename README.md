# Grover-search-on-quantum-database
This project demonstrates Grover's search algorithm on a simple database. But it can be easily scaled for real purpose when fault tolrent quantum computer's are available.

The pdf report discusses quantum oracle design and application of Grover algo to find an item in database.

The Jupyter Notebook Grover_Search_on_a_Database.ipynb discusses the code that demonstrates how a simple classical database can be encoded as a quantum oracle to perform search.

This implementation demonstates the true meaning of an oracle query in the context of database access.
